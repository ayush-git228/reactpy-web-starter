ReactPy Web Starter

Key Benefits:

Write your entire app (backend and frontend) in Pythonâ€”no JavaScript required.

No need for bundlers like Webpack or Babel; ReactPy handles frontend rendering from Python directly.

Quickly prototype dashboards without traditional web development overhead.

Easily integrate with Python libraries for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), visualization (Plotly).

Includes production-ready templates with secure authentication, robust data handling, and clean component structures.

How It Works:

ReactPy manages a Virtual DOM (VDOM) in Python. When your Python state changes, ReactPy efficiently updates the browser UI, similar to how React works in JavaScript, but using Python instead.

Included Templates:

landing: Simple landing page.

auth: Secure authentication demo (JWT-based).

dashboard: Interactive data dashboard (file upload, tables, Plotly charts).

theming: Light/dark mode and UI customization using Tailwind CSS.

Getting Started:

Make sure you have Python 3+ and pip. Using a virtual environment is recommended.

Install with:

text
pip install reactpy-web-starter
Create a new project:

text
reactpy-web-starter create <template-name> <your-project-name>
Example:

text
reactpy-web-starter create dashboard my-data-app
Navigate to your project, install dependencies, and run:

text
cd my-data-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
To preview a template without creating a project:

text
reactpy-web-starter run <template-name>

Publishing Your Project:

Prepare your pyproject.toml and setup.py with correct metadata and dependencies.

Build and upload your package using build and twine.
